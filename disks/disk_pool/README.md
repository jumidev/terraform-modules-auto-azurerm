# azurerm_disk_pool

Manages a Disk Pool.!> **Note:** Azure are officially [halting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/attach-disk-pools-to-azure-vmware-solution-hosts?tabs=azure-cli) the preview of Azure Disk Pools, and it **will not** be made generally available. New customers will not be able to register the Microsoft.StoragePool resource provider on their subscription and deploy new Disk Pools. Existing subscriptions registered with Microsoft.StoragePool may continue to deploy and manage disk pools for the time being.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "disks/disk_pool"   
}

inputs = {
   name = "The name of the Disk Pool"   
   resource_group_name = "${resource_group}"   
   location = "${location}"   
   zones = "Specifies a list of Availability Zones in which this Disk Pool should be located..."   
   sku_name = "The SKU of the Disk Pool"   
   # subnet_id â†’ set in tfstate_inputs
}

tfstate_inputs = {
   subnet_id = "path/to/subnet_component:id"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```
## Optional associated resource

| `tfstate_input` variable | Information |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **managed_disk_id** | If set to a valid `azurerm_managed_disk` `id`, makes a **azurerm_disk_pool_managed_disk_attachment** - Manages a Disk Pool Managed Disk Attachment.!> **Note:** Azure are officially [halting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/attach-disk-pools-to-azure-vmware-solution-hosts?tabs=azure-cli) the preview of Azure Disk Pools, and it **will not** be made generally available. New customers will not be able to register the Microsoft.StoragePool resource provider on their subscription and deploy new Disk Pools. Existing subscriptions registered with Microsoft.StoragePool may continue to deploy and manage disk pools for the time being.~> **Note:** Must be either a premium SSD, standard SSD, or an ultra disk in the same region and availability zone as the disk pool.~> **Note:** Ultra disks must have a disk sector size of 512 bytes.~> **Note:** Must be a shared disk, with a maxShares value of two or greater.~> **Note:** You must provide the StoragePool resource provider RBAC permissions to the disks that will be added to the disk pool.|

Example associated resources in a `tfstate_inputs` block:

```hcl
tfstate_inputs = {
   managed_disk_id = "path/to/managed_disk_component:id"
}
```
