# azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool_address

Manages a Backend Address within a Backend Address Pool.-> **Note:** Backend Addresses can only be added to a `Standard` SKU Load Balancer.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "load_balancer/lb_backend_address_pool_address"   
}

inputs = {
   # backend_address_pool_id â†’ set in component_inputs
   name = "The name which should be used for this Backend Address Pool Address..."   
}

component_inputs = {
   backend_address_pool_id = "path/to/lb_backend_address_pool_component:id"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```
