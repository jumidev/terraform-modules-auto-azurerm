# azurerm_network_manager_deployment

Manages a Network Manager Deployment.~> **NOTE on Virtual Network Peering:** Using Network Manager Deployment to deploy Connectivity Configuration may modify or delete existing Virtual Network Peering. At this time you should not use [Network Peering resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/virtual_network_peering) in conjunction with Network Manager Deployment. Doing so may cause a conflict of Peering configurations.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git" 
   path = "network/network_manager_deployment" 
}

inputs = {
   # network_manager_id â†’ set in tfstate_inputs
   location = "${location}" 
   scope_access = "scope_access of network_manager_deployment" 
   configuration_ids = "configuration_ids of network_manager_deployment" 
}

tfstate_inputs = {
   network_manager_id = "path/to/network_manager_component:id" 
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}" 
   container = "${container}" 
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}" 
}

```
