# azurerm_route

Manages a Route within a Route Table.~> **NOTE on Route Tables and Routes:** Terraform currentlyprovides both a standalone [Route resource](route.html), and allows for Routes to be defined in-line within the [Route Table resource](route_table.html).At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line Routes in conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of Route configurations and will overwrite Routes.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "network/route"   
}

inputs = {
   name = "The name of the route"   
   resource_group_name = "${resource_group}"   
   # route_table_name â†’ set in tfstate_inputs
   address_prefix = "The destination to which the route applies"   
   next_hop_type = "The type of Azure hop the packet should be sent to"   
}

tfstate_inputs = {
   route_table_name = "path/to/route_table_component:name"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```

## Required Variables

| Name | Type |  possible values |  Description |
