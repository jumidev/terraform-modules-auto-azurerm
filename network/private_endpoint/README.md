## Optional associated resource


### `application_security_group_id` 

- If set to a valid `azurerm_application_security_group` `id`, makes a **azurerm_private_endpoint_application_security_group_association** - 

Example component snippet (**See also** [network/application_security_group](https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm/tree/master/network/application_security_group))

```hcl
component_inputs = {
   application_security_group_id = "path/to/application_security_group_component:id"
}
```


## Required Variables

| Name | Type |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- |
| **name** | string |  Specifies the Name of the Private Endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **resource_group_name** | string |  Specifies the Name of the Resource Group within which the Private Endpoint should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **location** | string |  The supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **subnet_id** | string |  The ID of the Subnet from which Private IP Addresses will be allocated for this Private Endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **private_service_connection** | [block](#private_service_connection-block-structure) |  A `private_service_connection` block. | 

## Optional Variables

| Name | Type |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- |
| **custom_network_interface_name** | string |  The custom name of the network interface attached to the private endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **private_dns_zone_group** | [block](#private_dns_zone_group-block-structure) |  A `private_dns_zone_group` block. | 
| **ip_configuration** | [block](#ip_configuration-block-structure) |  One or more `ip_configuration` blocks. This allows a static IP address to be set for this Private Endpoint, otherwise an address is dynamically allocated from the Subnet. | 
| **tags** | map |  A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. | 

### `private_service_connection` block structure

| Name | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `name` | string | Yes | - | Specifies the Name of the Private Service Connection. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `is_manual_connection` | string | Yes | - | Does the Private Endpoint require Manual Approval from the remote resource owner? Changing this forces a new resource to be created. -> **NOTE:** If you are trying to connect the Private Endpoint to a remote resource without having the correct RBAC permissions on the remote resource set this value to 'true'. |
| `private_connection_resource_id` | string | No | - | The ID of the Private Link Enabled Remote Resource which this Private Endpoint should be connected to. One of 'private_connection_resource_id' or 'private_connection_resource_alias' must be specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. For a web app or function app slot, the parent web app should be used in this field instead of a reference to the slot itself. |
| `private_connection_resource_alias` | string | No | - | The Service Alias of the Private Link Enabled Remote Resource which this Private Endpoint should be connected to. One of 'private_connection_resource_id' or 'private_connection_resource_alias' must be specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `subresource_names` | list | No | - | A list of subresource names which the Private Endpoint is able to connect to. 'subresource_names' corresponds to 'group_id'. Possible values are detailed in the product [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#private-link-resource) in the 'Subresources' column. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. -> **NOTE:** Some resource types (such as Storage Account) only support 1 subresource per private endpoint. |
| `request_message` | string | No | - | A message passed to the owner of the remote resource when the private endpoint attempts to establish the connection to the remote resource. The request message can be a maximum of '140' characters in length. Only valid if 'is_manual_connection' is set to 'true'. |

### `private_dns_zone_group` block structure

| Name | Type | Required? | Default | Description |

### `ip_configuration` block structure

| Name | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `name` | string | Yes | - | Specifies the Name of the IP Configuration. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `private_ip_address` | string | Yes | - | Specifies the static IP address within the private endpoint's subnet to be used. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `subresource_name` | string | No | - | Specifies the subresource this IP address applies to. 'subresource_names' corresponds to 'group_id'. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `member_name` | string | No | - | Specifies the member name this IP address applies to. If it is not specified, it will use the value of 'subresource_name'. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. -> **NOTE:** 'member_name' will be required and will not take the value of 'subresource_name' in the next major version. |



## Outputs

| Name | Type | Sensitive? | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | --------- |
| **member_name** | string | No  | Specifies the member name this IP address applies to. If it is not specified, it will use the value of `subresource_name`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. -> **NOTE:** `member_name` will be required and will not take the value of `subresource_name` in the next major version. In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported: | 
| **id** | string | No  | The ID of the Private DNS Zone Config. | 
| **network_interface** | block | No  | A `network_interface` block. | 
| **custom_dns_configs** | block | No  | A `custom_dns_configs` block. | 
| **private_dns_zone_configs** | block | No  | A `private_dns_zone_configs` block. |

| **name** | string | No  | The name of the Private DNS Zone that the config belongs to. | 
| **fqdn** | string | No  | The fully qualified domain name to the `private_dns_zone`. | 
| **ip_addresses** | list | No  | A list of all IP Addresses that map to the `private_dns_zone` fqdn. -> **NOTE:** If a Private DNS Zone Group has not been configured correctly the `record_sets` attributes will be empty. | 
| **private_dns_zone_id** | list | No  | A list of IP Addresses | 
| **record_sets** | block | No  | A `record_sets` block. | 
| **private_ip_address** | string | No  | The static IP address set by this configuration. It is recommended to use the private IP address exported in the `private_service_connection` block to obtain the address associated with the private endpoint. | 
| **subresource_name** | string | No  | The subresource this IP address applies to, which corresponds to the `group_id`. | 
| **type** | string | No  | The type of DNS record. | 
| **ttl** | number | No  | The time to live for each connection to the `private_dns_zone`. | 

Additionally, all variables are provided as outputs.
