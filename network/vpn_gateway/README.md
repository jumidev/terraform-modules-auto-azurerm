# azurerm_vpn_gateway

Manages a VPN Gateway within a Virtual Hub, which enables Site-to-Site communication.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "network/vpn_gateway"   
}

inputs = {
   name = "The Name which should be used for this VPN Gateway"   
   resource_group_name = "${resource_group}"   
   location = "${location}"   
   # virtual_hub_id â†’ set in component_inputs
}

component_inputs = {
   virtual_hub_id = "path/to/virtual_hub_component:id"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```
