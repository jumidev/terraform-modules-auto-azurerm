# azurerm_data_factory_linked_custom_service

Manages a Linked Service (connection) between a resource and Azure Data Factory. This is a generic resource that supports all different Linked Service Types.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "data_factory/data_factory_linked_custom_service"   
}

inputs = {
   name = "Specifies the name of the Data Factory Linked Service..."   
   # data_factory_id â†’ set in component_inputs
   type = "The type of data stores that will be connected to Data Factory..."   
   type_properties_json = "A JSON object that contains the properties of the Data Factory Linked Service..."   
}

component_inputs = {
   data_factory_id = "path/to/data_factory_component:id"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```
