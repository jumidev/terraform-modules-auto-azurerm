# azurerm_synapse_workspace_key

Manages Synapse Workspace keys-> **Note:** Keys that are actively protecting a workspace cannot be deleted. When the keys resource is deleted, if the key is inactive it will be deleted, if it is active it will not be deleted.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "synapse/synapse_workspace_key"   
}

inputs = {
   customer_managed_key_name = "Specifies the name of the workspace key"   
   # synapse_workspace_id â†’ set in component_inputs
   active = "Specifies if the workspace should be encrypted with this key..."   
}

component_inputs = {
   synapse_workspace_id = "path/to/synapse_workspace_component:id"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```
