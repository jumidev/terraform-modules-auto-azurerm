# azurerm_kubernetes_cluster_node_pool

Manages a Node Pool within a Kubernetes Cluster-> **Note:** Due to the fast-moving nature of AKS, we recommend using the latest version of the Azure Provider when using AKS - you can find [the latest version of the Azure Provider here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest).~> **NOTE:** Multiple Node Pools are only supported when the Kubernetes Cluster is using Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "container/kubernetes_cluster_node_pool"   
}

inputs = {
   name = "The name of the Node Pool which should be created within the Kubernetes Cluster..."   
   # kubernetes_cluster_id â†’ set in component_inputs
   vm_size = "The SKU which should be used for the Virtual Machines used in this Node Pool..."   
}

component_inputs = {
   kubernetes_cluster_id = "path/to/kubernetes_cluster_component:id"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```
