# azurerm_virtual_desktop_host_pool_registration_info

Manages the Registration Info for a Virtual Desktop Host Pool.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "desktop_virtualization/virtual_desktop_host_pool_registration_info"   
}

inputs = {
   expiration_date = "A valid `RFC3339Time` for the expiration of the token..."   
   hostpool_id = "The ID of the Virtual Desktop Host Pool to link the Registration Info to..."   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```

## Required Variables

| Name | Type |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- |
| **expiration_date** | string |  A valid `RFC3339Time` for the expiration of the token.. | 
| **hostpool_id** | string |  The ID of the Virtual Desktop Host Pool to link the Registration Info to. Changing this forces a new Registration Info resource to be created. Only a single virtual_desktop_host_pool_registration_info resource should be associated with a given hostpool. Assigning multiple resources will produce inconsistent results. | 



## Outputs

| Name | Type | Sensitive? | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | --------- |
| **id** | string | No  | The ID of the Virtual Desktop Host Pool Registration Info resource. | 
| **token** | string | No  | The registration token generated by the Virtual Desktop Host Pool for registration of session hosts. |
