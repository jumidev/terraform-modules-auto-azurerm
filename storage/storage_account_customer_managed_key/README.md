# azurerm_storage_account_customer_managed_key

Manages a Customer Managed Key for a Storage Account.~> **NOTE:** It's possible to define a Customer Managed Key both within [the `azurerm_storage_account` resource](storage_account.html) via the `customer_managed_key` block and by using [the `azurerm_storage_account_customer_managed_key` resource](storage_account_customer_managed_key.html). However it's not possible to use both methods to manage a Customer Managed Key for a Storage Account, since there'll be conflicts.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "storage/storage_account_customer_managed_key"   
}

inputs = {
   # storage_account_id â†’ set in tfstate_inputs
   key_name = "key_name of storage_account_customer_managed_key"   
}

tfstate_inputs = {
   storage_account_id = "path/to/storage_account_component:id"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```
