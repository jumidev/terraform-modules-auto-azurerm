# azurerm_storage_encryption_scope

Manages a Storage Encryption Scope.~> **Note:** Storage Encryption Scopes are in Preview [more information can be found here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/encryption-scope-manage).

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git" 
   path = "storage/storage_encryption_scope" 
}

inputs = {
   name = "name of storage_encryption_scope" 
   source = "source of storage_encryption_scope" 
   # storage_account_id â†’ set in tfstate_inputs
}

tfstate_inputs = {
   storage_account_id = "path/to/storage_account_component:id" 
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}" 
   container = "${container}" 
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}" 
}

```

## Required Variables

| Name | Type |  possible values |  Description |
