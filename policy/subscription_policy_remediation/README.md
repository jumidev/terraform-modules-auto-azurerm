}

inputs = {
   name = "The name of the Policy Remediation"   
   # subscription_id â†’ set in component_inputs
   policy_assignment_id = "The ID of the Policy Assignment that should be remediated..."   
}

component_inputs = {
   subscription_id = "path/to/subscription_component:subscription_id"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

| **policy_assignment_id** | string |  The ID of the Policy Assignment that should be remediated. | 

## Optional Variables

| Name | Type |  Default  |  possible values |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **policy_definition_id** | string |  -  |  -  |  The unique ID for the policy definition within the policy set definition that should be remediated. Required when the policy assignment being remediated assigns a policy set definition. | 
| **policy_definition_reference_id** | string |  -  |  -  |  The unique ID for the policy definition reference within the policy set definition that should be remediated. Required when the policy assignment being remediated assigns a policy set definition. |
