# azurerm_dns_ns_record

Enables you to manage DNS NS Records within Azure DNS.~> **Note:** [The Azure DNS API has a throttle limit of 500 read (GET) operations per 5 minutes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/request-limits-and-throttling#network-throttling) - whilst the default read timeouts will work for most cases - in larger configurations you may need to set a larger [read timeout](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) then the default 5min. Although, we'd generally recommend that you split the resources out into smaller Terraform configurations to avoid the problem entirely.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "dns/dns_ns_record"   
}

inputs = {
   name = "The name of the DNS NS Record"   
   resource_group_name = "${resource_group}"   
   # zone_name â†’ set in component_inputs
   ttl = "The Time To Live (TTL) of the DNS record in seconds..."   
   records = "A list of values that make up the NS record"   
}

component_inputs = {
   zone_name = "path/to/dns_zone_component:name"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```

## Required Variables

| **zone_name** | string |  Specifies the DNS Zone where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **ttl** | number |  The Time To Live (TTL) of the DNS record in seconds. | 
| **records** | list |  A list of values that make up the NS record. | 

## Optional Variables

| Name | Type |  Description |
