# azurerm_api_management_custom_domain

Manages a API Management Custom Domain.## Disclaimers~> **Note:** It's possible to define Custom Domains both within [the `azurerm_api_management` resource](api_management.html) via the `hostname_configurations` block and by using this resource. However it's not possible to use both methods to manage Custom Domains within an API Management Service, since there will be conflicts.

## Example minimal component.hclt

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git" 
   path = "api_management/api_management_custom_domain" 
}

inputs = {
   api_management_id = "api_management_id of api_management_custom_domain" 
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}" 
   container = "${container}" 
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}" 
}

```
