## Required Variables

| Name | Type |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- |
| **name** | string |  The name which should be used for this Front Door Origin Group. Changing this forces a new Front Door Origin Group to be created. | 
| **cdn_frontdoor_profile_id** | string |  The ID of the Front Door Profile within which this Front Door Origin Group should exist. Changing this forces a new Front Door Origin Group to be created. | 
| **load_balancing** | [block](#load_balancing-block-structure) |  A `load_balancing` block. | 

## Optional Variables

| Name | Type |  Default  |  possible values |  Description |

| `sample_size` | number | No | 4 | Specifies the number of samples to consider for load balancing decisions. Possible values are between '0' and '255' (inclusive). Defaults to '4'. |
| `successful_samples_required` | number | No | 3 | Specifies the number of samples within the sample period that must succeed. Possible values are between '0' and '255' (inclusive). Defaults to '3'. |

### `health_probe` block structure

| `path` | bool | No | False | Specifies the path relative to the origin that is used to determine the health of the origin. Defaults to '/'. -> **NOTE:** Health probes can only be disabled if there is a single enabled origin in a single enabled origin group.
