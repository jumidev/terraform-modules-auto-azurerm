   location = "${location}"   
   maintenance_window = {
      day_of_week = "..."      
      time_of_day_in_utc = "..."      
   }
   
   sku_name = "The SKU name for the Azure Managed Lustre File System..."   
   storage_capacity_in_tb = "The size of the Azure Managed Lustre File System in TiB..."   
   # subnet_id â†’ set in tfstate_inputs
   zones = "A list of availability zones for the Azure Managed Lustre File System..."   
}

tfstate_inputs = {
   subnet_id = "path/to/subnet_component:id"

| **resource_group_name** | string |  -  |  The name of the Resource Group where the Azure Managed Lustre File System should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **location** | string |  -  |  The Azure Region where the Azure Managed Lustre File System should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **maintenance_window** | [block](#maintenance_window-block-structure) |  -  |  A `maintenance_window` block. | 
| **sku_name** | string |  `AMLFS-Durable-Premium-40`, `AMLFS-Durable-Premium-125`, `AMLFS-Durable-Premium-250`, `AMLFS-Durable-Premium-500`  |  The SKU name for the Azure Managed Lustre File System. Possible values are `AMLFS-Durable-Premium-40`, `AMLFS-Durable-Premium-125`, `AMLFS-Durable-Premium-250` and `AMLFS-Durable-Premium-500`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **storage_capacity_in_tb** | string |  `sku_name`  |  The size of the Azure Managed Lustre File System in TiB. The valid values for this field are dependant on which `sku_name` has been defined in the configuration file. For more information on the valid values for this field please see the [product documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-managed-lustre/create-file-system-resource-manager#file-system-type-and-size-options). Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **subnet_id** | string |  -  |  The resource ID of the Subnet that is used for managing the Azure Managed Lustre file system and for client-facing operations. This subnet should have at least a /24 subnet mask within the Virtual Network's address space. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **zones** | list |  -  |  A list of availability zones for the Azure Managed Lustre File System. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 

## Optional Variables
