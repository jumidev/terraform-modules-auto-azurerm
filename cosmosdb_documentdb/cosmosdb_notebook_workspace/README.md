# azurerm_cosmosdb_notebook_workspace

Manages an SQL Notebook Workspace.!> **Note:** CosmosDb Notebook Workspace is now Deprecated - as such the `azurerm_cosmosdb_notebook_workspace` resource is deprecated and will be removed in v4.0 of the AzureRM Provider.~> **NOTE:** CosmosDb Notebook (the feature itself) is not deprecated and will return: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/notebooks-faq>.~> **NOTE:** However, CosmosDb Notebook feature no longer uses the permanent notebook workspace being referred to the public surface in the RP (have since moved to temporary notebooks workspaces which are short-lived <1 hour).

}

inputs = {
   name = "The name which should be used for this SQL Notebook Workspace..."   
   resource_group_name = "${resource_group}"   
   # account_name â†’ set in component_inputs
}

component_inputs = {
   account_name = "path/to/cosmosdb_account_component:name"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```
