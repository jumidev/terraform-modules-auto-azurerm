## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "cosmosdb_documentdb/cosmosdb_table"   
}

inputs = {
   name = "Specifies the name of the Cosmos DB Table"   
   resource_group_name = "${resource_group}"   
   # account_name â†’ set in component_inputs
}

component_inputs = {
   account_name = "path/to/cosmosdb_account_component:name"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```

## Required Variables

| Name | Type |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- |
| **name** | string |  Specifies the name of the Cosmos DB Table. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **resource_group_name** | string |  The name of the resource group in which the Cosmos DB Table is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **account_name** | string |  The name of the Cosmos DB Table to create the table within. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 

## Optional Variables

| Name | Type |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- |
| **throughput** | string |  The throughput of Table (RU/s). Must be set in increments of `100`. The minimum value is `400`. This must be set upon database creation otherwise it cannot be updated without a manual terraform destroy-apply. ~> **Note:** throughput has a maximum value of `1000000` unless a higher limit is requested via Azure Support | 
| **autoscale_settings** | [block](#autoscale_settings-block-structure) |  An `autoscale_settings` block. This must be set upon database creation otherwise it cannot be updated without a manual terraform destroy-apply. ~> **Note:** Switching between autoscale and manual throughput is not supported via Terraform and must be completed via the Azure Portal and refreshed. | 

### `autoscale_settings` block structure

| Name | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `max_throughput` | string | No | - | The maximum throughput of the Table (RU/s). Must be between '1,000' and '1,000,000'. Must be set in increments of '1,000'. Conflicts with 'throughput'. |



## Outputs
