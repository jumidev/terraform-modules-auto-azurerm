   # cognitive_account_id â†’ set in tfstate_inputs
   model = {
      format = "..."      
      name = "..."      
      version = "..."      
   }
   
   scale = {
      type = "..."      
   }
   
}

tfstate_inputs = {

## Required Variables

| Name | Type |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- |
| **name** | string |  The name of the Cognitive Services Account Deployment. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **cognitive_account_id** | string |  The ID of the Cognitive Services Account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **model** | [block](#model-block-structure) |  A `model` block. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **scale** | [block](#scale-block-structure) |  A `scale` block. | 

## Optional Variables

| Name | Type |  Default  |  possible values |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **rai_policy_name** | string |  -  |  -  |  The name of RAI policy. | 
| **version_upgrade_option** | string |  `OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable`  |  `OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable`, `OnceCurrentVersionExpired`, `NoAutoUpgrade`  |  Deployment model version upgrade option. Possible values are `OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable`, `OnceCurrentVersionExpired`, and `NoAutoUpgrade`. Defaults to `OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 

### `model` block structure

| Name | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `format` | string | Yes | - | The format of the Cognitive Services Account Deployment model. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Possible value is 'OpenAI'. |
| `name` | string | Yes | - | The name of the Cognitive Services Account Deployment model. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `version` | string | Yes | - | The version of Cognitive Services Account Deployment model. |

### `scale` block structure

| Name | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `type` | string | Yes | - | The name of the SKU. Ex - 'Standard' or 'P3'. It is typically a letter+number code. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `tier` | string | No | - | Possible values are 'Free', 'Basic', 'Standard', 'Premium', 'Enterprise'. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `size` | string | No | - | The SKU size. When the name field is the combination of tier and some other value, this would be the standalone code. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `family` | string | No | - | If the service has different generations of hardware, for the same SKU, then that can be captured here. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `capacity` | string | No | 1 | Tokens-per-Minute (TPM). The unit of measure for this field is in the thousands of Tokens-per-Minute. Defaults to '1' which means that the limitation is '1000' tokens per minute. If the resources SKU supports scale in/out then the capacity field should be included in the resources' configuration. If the scale in/out is not supported by the resources SKU then this field can be safely omitted. For more information about TPM please see the [product documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/quota?tabs=rest). |
