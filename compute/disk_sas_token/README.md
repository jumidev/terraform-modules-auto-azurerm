# azurerm_disk_sas_token

Manages a Disk SAS Token.Use this resource to obtain a Shared Access Signature (SAS Token) for an existing Managed Disk.Shared access signatures allow fine-grained, ephemeral access control to various aspects of Managed Disk similar to blob/storage account container.With the help of this resource, data from the disk can be copied from managed disk to a storage blob or to some other system without the need of azcopy.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "compute/disk_sas_token"   
}

inputs = {
   # managed_disk_id â†’ set in component_inputs
   duration_in_seconds = "The duration for which the export should be allowed..."   
   access_level = "The level of access required on the disk"   
}

component_inputs = {
   managed_disk_id = "path/to/managed_disk_component:id"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```

## Required Variables

| Name | Type |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- |
| **managed_disk_id** | string |  The ID of an existing Managed Disk which should be exported. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **duration_in_seconds** | number |  The duration for which the export should be allowed. Should be between 30 & 4294967295 seconds. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **access_level** | string |  The level of access required on the disk. Supported are Read, Write. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Refer to the [SAS creation reference from Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/disks/grant-access) for additional details on the fields above. | 



## Outputs

| Name | Type | Sensitive? | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | --------- |
| **access_level** | string | No  | The level of access required on the disk. Supported are Read, Write. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Refer to the [SAS creation reference from Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/compute/disks/grant-access) for additional details on the fields above. In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported: | 
| **id** | string | No  | The ID of the Disk Export resource. | 
| **sas_url** | string | No  | The computed Shared Access Signature (SAS) of the Managed Disk. | 

Additionally, all variables are provided as outputs.
