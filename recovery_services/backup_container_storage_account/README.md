# azurerm_backup_container_storage_account

Manages registration of a storage account with Azure Backup. Storage accounts must be registered with an Azure Recovery Vault in order to backup file shares within the storage account. Registering a storage account with a vault creates what is known as a protection container within Azure Recovery Services. Once the container is created, Azure file shares within the storage account can be backed up using the `azurerm_backup_protected_file_share` resource.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git" 
   path = "recovery_services/backup_container_storage_account" 
}

inputs = {
   resource_group_name = "${resource_group}" 
   recovery_vault_name = "recovery_vault_name of backup_container_storage_account" 
   # storage_account_id â†’ set in tfstate_inputs
}

tfstate_inputs = {
   storage_account_id = "path/to/storage_account_component:id" 
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}" 
   container = "${container}" 
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}" 
}

```
