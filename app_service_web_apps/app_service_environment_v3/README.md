# azurerm_app_service_environment_v3

Manages a 3rd Generation (v3) App Service Environment.

## Example `component.hclt`

```hcl
source = {
   repo = "https://github.com/jumidev/terraform-modules-auto-azurerm.git"   
   path = "app_service_web_apps/app_service_environment_v3"   
}

inputs = {
   name = "The name of the App Service Environment"   
   resource_group_name = "subnet_id"   
   # subnet_id â†’ set in tfstate_inputs
}

tfstate_inputs = {
   subnet_id = "path/to/subnet_component:id"   
}

tfstate_store = {
   storage_account = "${storage_account}"   
   container = "${container}"   
   container_path = "${COMPONENT_PATH}"   
}

```

## Required Variables

| Name | Type |  Default  |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- | ----------- |
| **name** | string |  -  |  The name of the App Service Environment. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **resource_group_name** | string |  `subnet_id`  |  The name of the Resource Group where the App Service Environment exists. Defaults to the Resource Group of the Subnet (specified by `subnet_id`). Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **subnet_id** | string |  -  |  The ID of the Subnet which the App Service Environment should be connected to. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 

## Optional Variables

| Name | Type |  Default  |  possible values |  Description |
| ---- | --------- |  ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **allow_new_private_endpoint_connections** | bool |  `True`  |  -  |  Should new Private Endpoint Connections be allowed. Defaults to `true`. | 
| **cluster_setting** | [block](#cluster_setting-block-structure) |  -  |  -  |  Zero or more `cluster_setting` blocks. | 
| **dedicated_host_count** | string |  -  |  `2`  |  This ASEv3 should use dedicated Hosts. Possible values are `2`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **zone_redundant** | string |  -  |  `dedicated_host_count`, `zone_redundant`  |  Set to `true` to deploy the ASEv3 with availability zones supported. Zonal ASEs can be deployed in some regions, you can refer to [Availability Zone support for App Service Environments](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/zone-redundancy). You can only set either `dedicated_host_count` or `zone_redundant` but not both. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **internal_load_balancing_mode** | string |  `None`  |  `None`, `"Web, Publishing"`  |  Specifies which endpoints to serve internally in the Virtual Network for the App Service Environment. Possible values are `None` (for an External VIP Type), and `"Web, Publishing"` (for an Internal VIP Type). Defaults to `None`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **tags** | map |  -  |  -  |  A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. | 

### `cluster_setting` block structure

| Name | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
