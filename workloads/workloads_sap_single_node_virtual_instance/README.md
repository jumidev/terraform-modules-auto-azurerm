| ---- | --------- |  ----------- |
| **identity** | [block](#identity-block-structure) |  An `identity` block. | 
| **managed_resource_group_name** | string |  The name of the managed Resource Group for the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. | 
| **tags** | map |  A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance. | 

### `disk_volume_configuration` block structure

| Name | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `volume_name` | string | Yes | - | Specifies the volumn name of the database disk. Possible values are 'backup', 'hana/data', 'hana/log', 'hana/shared', 'os' and 'usr/sap'. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `number_of_disks` | number | Yes | - | The total number of disks required for the concerned volume. Possible values are at least '1'. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `size_in_gb` | number | Yes | - | The size of the Disk in GB. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `sku_name` | string | Yes | - | The name of the Disk SKU. Possible values are 'Premium_LRS', 'PremiumV2_LRS', 'Premium_ZRS', 'Standard_LRS', 'StandardSSD_LRS', 'StandardSSD_ZRS' and 'UltraSSD_LRS'. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |

### `single_server_configuration` block structure

| Name | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `app_resource_group_name` | string | Yes | - | The name of the application Resource Group where SAP system resources will be deployed. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. ~> **Note:** While creating an SAP Single Node Virtual Instance, the service will provision the extra SAP systems/components in the 'app_resource_group_name' that are not defined in the HCL Configuration. At this time, if the 'app_resource_group_name' is different from the Resource Group where SAP Single Node Virtual Instance exists, you can set 'prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources' to 'false' to delete all resources defined in the HCL Configuration and the resources created in the 'app_resource_group_name' with 'terraform destroy'. However, if the 'app_resource_group_name' is the same with the Resource Group where SAP Single Node Virtual Instance exists, some resources, such as the subnet defined in the HCL Configuration, cannot be deleted with 'terraform destroy' since the resources defined in the HCL Configuration are being referenced by the SAP system/component. In this case, you have to manually delete the SAP system/component before deleting the resources in the HCL Configuration. |
| `subnet_id` | string | Yes | - | The resource ID of the Subnet for the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `virtual_machine_configuration` | [block](#virtual_machine_configuration-block-structure) | Yes | - | A 'virtual_machine_configuration' block. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |

| `disk_volume_configuration` | [block](#disk_volume_configuration-block-structure) | No | - | One or more 'disk_volume_configuration' blocks. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `secondary_ip_enabled` | bool | No | False | Specifies whether a secondary IP address should be added to the network interface on all VMs of the SAP system being deployed. Defaults to 'false'. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
| `virtual_machine_resource_names` | [block](#virtual_machine_resource_names-block-structure) | No | - | A 'virtual_machine_resource_names' block. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. |
